            <p>Glitzy Dubai is the United Arab Emirates’ holiday hot spot. This city of high-rises 
                and shopping malls has transformed itself from a desert outpost to a destination du-jour, 
                where tourists flock for sales bargains, sunshine, and family fun.</p>

    <p><b>Dubai Creek </b>separates the city into two towns with Deira to the north and Bur Dubaito the south.
         The creek has been an influential element in the city’s growth, first attracting settlers here to fish and
          pearl dive. Small villages grew up alongside the creek as far back as 4,000 years ago, while the
           modern era began in the 1830s when the Bani Yas tribe settled in the area. The Dhow Wharfage is located 
           along Dubai Creek’s bank, north of Al-Maktoum Bridge.</p>

    <p><b>Dubai Aquarium </b>is one of the city’s top tourist attractions, the Dubai Aquarium houses 140 species of sea life
         in the huge suspended tank on the ground floor of the Dubai Mall. 
         As well as free viewing from the mall, 
         if you enter the Underwater Zoo, you can walk through the aquarium tunnels. 
        Different activities help you get a closer look at the sea life. 
        Glass bottom boat tours (on top of the tank) are particularly popular. 
        Cage snorkeling and shark diving activities are also on offer.</p>
