<h1>Dubai</h1>
<p>One of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. It is rather like an independent city-state and is the most 
    modern and progressive emirate in the UAE, developing at an unbelievable pace in the tourist and trade sectors especially.</p>
    
        <div>

        <p>Dubai is essentially a desert city with superb infrastructure, liberal policies (by regional standards), that became popular for its excellent tourist amenities. 
            Just 5 h from Europe and 3 h from most parts of the Middle East, the Near East, and the subcontinent of India, 
            Dubai makes a great short break for shopping, partying, sunbathing, fine dining, sporting events, and even a few sinful pleasures.</p>

        <div>
            <img class="img-right"src="project1-images/dubai-night.jpg"  alt="">
            <p>It is a city of superlatives: for the fastest, biggest, tallest, largest and highest, Dubai is the destination. One of Dubaiâ€™s claims to fame is its vibrant night life; 
                Dubai has much to offer in terms of late night entertainment and the emirate regularly hosts some of the most popular club nights and DJs from around the globe. 
                There are many bars and nightclubs in Dubai, though most of these are located in hotels. 
                The crowd varies from club to club, but mostly consists of a mix of party goers of both Eastern and Western origin.</p>
